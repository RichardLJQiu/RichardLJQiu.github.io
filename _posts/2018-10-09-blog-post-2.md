My wonderful experience at the VeloSano 4 during July 20â€“22, 2018.

I had great fun while riding during the VeloSano event this year. I decided to not be a virtual rider and volunteer anymore, did 50 miles challenge route this year. Well, guess what you get when you ride 50 miles without any formal practice and training. I cramped several times during the six and half hours' ride. T_T
