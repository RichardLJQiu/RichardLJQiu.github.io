I just launched my personal website! :) It will be my home base for recording my work, research and life. 

GitHub-based personal webpage is really cool!
======

I have tried to create my personal webpage using many ways and hosts. There were all sorts of problems that prevented me from maintaining the webpage. However, I feel it is drastically different this time. I really love the idea of building personal webpages on GitHub. The open source repository solution seems offer the best and easiest option to programmers who want to have personal webpage and do blogging. Thanks GitHub user, academicpages, for the template they created. ^_^
