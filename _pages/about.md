I am currently a second-year Medical Physics Resident at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA. It is truly a fulfilling life to be a medical physicist in the clinic that contributes to the care of our cancer patients. I have been conducting research on adaptive radiation therapy (ART) since I joined the Department as research fellow in 2015. Recently, I started using Convertional Neural Network algorithms that I learned from Github to segment prostate, bladder and rectum on daily Cone-Beam CT (CBCT), which is a widely-used imaging modality for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT).

I love to keep improving myself every day and learning new skills. Residency life is tough, but it instills a mindset of perseverance on me. The presentation and the book "Grit" by Dr. Angela Duckworth greatly inspired me. I started doing regular gym workout since March, 2017. Learning piano using the App "SimplyPiano" since April, 2018. I aslo did several fun home remodeling projects with my dad.
